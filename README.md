# Guess-the-Flag
Guess the Flag by Paul Hudson  In this SwiftUI project is a guessing game that helps you or users learn some of the many flags of the world.
I've added the score to this project. This project is very simple that gives a chance to introduce you to the whole range of SwiftUI functionality such as: stacks, buttons, images, alerts, asset catalogs and more. Thanks to Paul Hudson for his generous making the 100DaysOfSwiftUI to share his knowledge and skills about iOS Development.
